# Scanpan
Elasticsearch and Kibana setup for Penetration testing and reconnaissance.

## Description
Having to write custom shell scripts to parse and keep track of all the data from many different security tools is time consuming and often results in a mountain of text files. Other solutions to this problem often include yet more tools as well as features i'll never use nor care about. I needed something simple, lightweight, customisable, and easy to deploy without all the bloat.

*Work in Progress*
